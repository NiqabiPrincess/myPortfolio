        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m currently a first-year student at Humber, pursuing an advanced diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis. My passion for computer science has been a driving force in my academic journey, and I’ve enjoyed exploring it further through various experiences.
            <br><br>
            In high school, I had the opportunity to take several computer science courses, which laid a solid foundation for my programming skills. I also participated in the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) in 2019 and completed a few online coding courses, all of which have greatly enhanced my understanding of the field.
            <br><br>
            Beyond my studies, I have a diverse range of interests, including makeup, baking, cooking, knitting, and enjoying nature walks. I’m excited to continue developing my programming abilities and deepening my knowledge of computer science. I look forward to connecting with others who share my passions and interests!
